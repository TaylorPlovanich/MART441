Project Title: Trivia Challenge (Early Version)

Description:
This project is the initial foundation for a JavaScript/jQuery-based quiz/trivia game.
Currently, it features:

A Start Quiz button
A basic question and answer system
Score tracking using state
localStorage to save the most recent score
At this stage, the game simply asks the player a series of trivia questions, with the score increasing for each correct answer.

Future Development Plans:
The final version will likely expand the gameplay significantly.
Planned improvements include:

Adding more questions and categories (randomized).
Introducing a timer for each question.
Including feedback (such as "Correct!" or "Wrong!") after answering.
Creating a game over screen with a replay option.
Saving and displaying a high score from previous sessions.
Adding simple platformer elements:
Players may need to answer a trivia question correctly to unlock movement or progress to the next platform/level.
If the player answers incorrectly, obstacles or challenges will appear.
This hybrid trivia-platformer approach will aim to create a more interactive and dynamic experience for players rather than a traditional quiz alone.
