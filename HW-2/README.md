# Week 2 Homework

## Overview
This assignment involved creating a webpage that:
- Logs information (favorite websites, games, artists) to the console.
- Includes a user prompt and logs the response.
- Sets a primary background color using inline CSS.

## Reflection of AI 
I used ChatGPT to generate a version of the code.
1. **Differences:**
   - My code was obviously more personalized and included specific examples that reflect my likes.
   - I let AI choose my question, because I couldn't pick one. So, that made things simple.
2. **Understanding the Code:**
   - I wrote the code myself, well, following instructions, so I think I can confidently explain its functionality.
   - The AI-generated code is helpful. It's a good reference point, should I ever feel lost.
3. **Ownership:**
   - I feel the work is mine because I made deliberate decisions about what to include and how to structure it.
