Phaser Space Shooter Game

Game Overview

This is a simple space shooter game built using Phaser, where the player controls a spaceship to shoot falling enemies. The game starts with basic enemies and levels up to more difficult challenges. The objective is to achieve a high score without getting hit.

Initial Concept

Originally, the project was planned as a platformer/trivia game. The idea was to create a side-scrolling platformer with interactive trivia questions appearing at checkpoints. However, due to design changes, the concept shifted to a space shooter, focusing on fast-paced arcade gameplay.

How to Play

Use the arrow keys to move the player’s spaceship left and right.

Press the spacebar to shoot lasers at enemies.

The game progresses to a second level when the player’s score reaches 500.

The player wins upon reaching a score of 1000.

If an enemy collides with the player, the game is over.

The game can be restarted by clicking on the screen when game over or win text appears.
