- Includes a user prompt and logs the response.
- Sets a primary background color using inline CSS.

## Reflection on AI Usage
I used ChatGPT to generate a version of the code. Here's my comparison:
1. **Differences:**
   - My code was more personalized and included specific examples that reflect my preferences.
   - The AI-generated code used placeholder values that I had to modify to make it relevant.
2. **Understanding the Code:**
   - Since I wrote most of the code myself, I can confidently explain its functionality.
   - While the AI-generated code was helpful, relying solely on it would leave gaps in my understanding.
3. **Ownership:**
   - I feel the work is mine because I made deliberate decisions about what to include and how to structure it.
