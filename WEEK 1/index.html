        <h2>What I See When I Look at the World</h2>
        <p>When I look at the world, I see a boundless realm of infinite possibilities. It is a place filled with vibrant colors, diverse cultures, and endless innovation. Every person alive is a miracle. Each person truly has the power to create good and beauty. As it relates to games, I believe games have the power to unlock human potential, inspiring empathy, fostering problem-solving, and uniting people to imagine and build a brighter future.</p>

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Taylor Plovanich, and I am a junior at the University of Montana Online, majoring in Media Arts. My expected graduation date is Spring 2026. My journey includes creating projects that integrate animation, storytelling, and design. I draw inspiration from everyday life, art, and the evolving field of technology. Some of my notable projects include interactive Twine stories and unique digital art pieces created with Adobe Illustrator and After Effects.</p>

        <h2>Interests and Gaming Memories</h2>
        <p>One of my fondest memories is playing <em>Paper Mario</em> on the Nintendo 64 as a child.I was in the 5th grade when it released. It was the first game I had ever anticipated the arrival for. It didn't disappoint. It taught me the value of perseverance, exploration, and problem-solving. Today, I still find joy in games that challenge my creativity and critical thinking. I believe games can help us solve real-world problems by simulating scenarios, encouraging collaboration, and inspiring new ways of thinking.</p>
        <p>Outside of gaming, I enjoy hiking in the mountains of Montana, well, anything outdoorsy, and being with family and friends.</p>
