        <h2>What I See When I Look at the World</h2>
        <p>When I look at the world, I see a complex interplay of beauty, challenges, and potential. Our planet is full of vibrant colors, diverse cultures, and innovative ideas. However, it also faces significant issues such as climate change, inequality, and the need for more meaningful connections. I believe games can be a tool to inspire empathy, problem-solving, and awareness, bringing people together to tackle some of these challenges.</p>

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Taylor Plovanich, and I am a junior at the University of Montana Online, majoring in Media Arts. My expected graduation date is Spring 2026.

Some of my notable projects include interactive Twine stories and unique digital art pieces created with Adobe Illustrator and After Effects.</p>

        <h2>Interests and Gaming Memories</h2>
        <p>One of my fondest memories is playing <em>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</em> as a child. It taught me the value of perseverance, exploration, and problem-solving. Today, I still find joy in games that challenge my creativity and critical thinking. I believe games can help us solve real-world problems by simulating scenarios, encouraging collaboration, and inspiring new ways of thinking.</p>
        <p>Outside of gaming, I enjoy hiking in the mountains of Montana, experimenting with new art techniques, and exploring the potential of virtual and augmented reality in storytelling.</p>
